                    Radiative cooling is a natural process where materials release heat as infrared radiation into the cold atmosphere or outer space. 
                    Advanced materials can enhance this effect by reflecting sunlight while efficiently emitting heat, enabling cooling even during the day. 
                    This technology offers a sustainable and energy-efficient way to reduce temperatures without relying on electricity.
